# QuickPass

As any developer knows, a rite of passage when filling out your portfolio is to build a password generator. I thought I might as well give it an attempt of my own and strengthen some core javascript principles along the way by using nothing but vanilla javascript.

## Intended Functionality
* User can select the desired length of their password
* User can select the type of characters used in their password
* User can successfully generate a password based on their selections
* User can copy the generated password to their clipboard

## Desired Skills Development
* Continue to strengthen vanilla javascript skills
* Become more proficient with the use of object-orient javascript functions
* Learn how to copy to a clipboard using javascript

## Local Development Instructions
When developing locally, use `npm run scss` to make sure style changes are compiled with each change.

## Live Site
You can view a working version of the project at [https://quickpass.netlify.app/](https://quickpass.netlify.app/).
